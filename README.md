# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
### Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
This project is an analysis of weekly ride-share fares utilizing python, pandas, and ride-share data. Firstly, data is broken down into the 3 different city types: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. This data created a summary of the rideshare data by showing the total rides, total fares, total drivers, average fare per ride, and average fares per driver for each city type. Next, a pivot table is utilzed to allow the base data be indexed by date and separated into the 3 city types. This pivot table was then summarized in a new dataframe to show the fares of each city type by date without null values. Finally, this new dataframe was utilized to creat a chart to demonstrate how each city type compared to eachother in total fares across the given date range.


## Results:
### Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.


## Summary:
### Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
